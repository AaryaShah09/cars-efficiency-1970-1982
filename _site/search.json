Then, the company’s data was used to compare the efficiency, mileage, and fuel type, and engine size of cars during this time. The average number of miles per gallon that cars could produce increased by about 5-10% a year from 1970 to 2011, but saw an increase of up to 300% from 2011 to 2024 due to the introduction of electric and hybrid cars."
